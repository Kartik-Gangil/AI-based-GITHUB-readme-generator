## Overview

This project serves as a portfolio to showcase my skills and projects.  It's built with React and incorporates smooth animations using `@react-spring/parallax` and `@react-spring/web`.

## Technologies Used

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **React DOM:** Provides DOM-specific methods that are useful at the top level of your app.
*   **@react-spring/parallax:** Parallax scrolling animations for React.
*   **@react-spring/web:**  A powerful animation library for React.
*   **React Scripts:**  A set of scripts and configuration used by Create React App.
*   **Web Vitals:**  A library for measuring and reporting on Core Web Vitals.
*   **Testing Libraries:** `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/user-event` for testing the application.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed.  It's recommended to use the latest LTS version.  You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm or Yarn:**  Node Package Manager (npm) comes with Node.js. Alternatively, you can use Yarn.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url>
    cd portfolio
    ```

    (Replace `<your_repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository.)

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

Using npm:

```bash
npm start
```

Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will typically open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available:

*   `start`: Starts the development server.
*   `build`: Builds the application for production.
*   `test`: Runs the test suite.
*   `eject`: Ejects the project from `react-scripts`.  **Note:** This is a one-way operation. You can't go back!
